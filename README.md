# Resizable

first we need to declare design, for this reason i create a div with 100px width and 100px height , the div border color is blue . i create four indicator sign , these sign are top-left , top-right , bottom-left, bottom-right stay.

He realized that the fix for that bug is extremely simple, instead of applying the mousedown event on the resizer, he switched it to the whole window therefore if the mouse is somehow slipped out of the resizer again, the element will still resize base on the mouse position. He also added a mouseup event on the window object so that when he releases the mouse, the element will stop resizing. -->
